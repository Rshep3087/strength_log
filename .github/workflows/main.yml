# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      # Push events on master branch
      - master
      # Push events to branches matching feature/
      - 'feature/**'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      # Pull request events on master branch
      - master

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Install packages
        run: pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt

      # Check to see if Strength Log runs
      - name: Run Application
        run: |
          flask run
